# Security Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Exam Grader application and provides guidelines for secure deployment and usage.

## Security Features

### 1. File Upload Security

- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file extensions are accepted (.pdf, .docx, .doc, .txt, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .tiff, .bmp, .gif)
- **File Size Limits**: Maximum file size of 16MB for documents and 10MB for images
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevents directory traversal attacks using `../` or similar patterns
- **Secure Filename Handling**: Uses `secure_filename()` and additional validation
- **Temporary File Management**: Files are stored in secure temporary directories and cleaned up after processing

### 2. Session Security

- **Secure Cookies**: Session cookies are marked as secure (HTTPS only in production)
- **HttpOnly Cookies**: Prevents XSS attacks by making cookies inaccessible to JavaScript
- **SameSite Protection**: CSRF protection through SameSite cookie attribute
- **Session Timeout**: Automatic session expiration after 1 hour of inactivity

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **XSS Prevention**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries and input validation
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection (when Flask-WTF is available)
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse through request rate limiting

### 4. Error Handling

- **Information Disclosure Prevention**: Generic error messages in production
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Application continues to function even when some services are unavailable

## Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security settings
SECRET_KEY=<64-character-random-string>
SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600
CSRF_ENABLED=True
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=True
MAX_REQUESTS_PER_HOUR=1000
SECURE_COOKIES=True
```

### Production Deployment

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Strong Secret Key**: Generate a cryptographically secure secret key
3. **Environment Isolation**: Keep sensitive configuration in environment variables
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring and alerting

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
3. **Logging**: Log security-relevant events for monitoring
4. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and check for vulnerabilities
5. **Code Review**: Implement security-focused code reviews

### For Administrators

1. **Access Control**: Implement proper user authentication and authorization
2. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and network segmentation
3. **Backup Security**: Secure backup storage and regular testing
4. **Monitoring**: Implement comprehensive security monitoring
5. **Incident Response**: Have a security incident response plan

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Contact the development team directly
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Strong secret key configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Error handling reviewed
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Security testing completed

### Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Logs reviewed regularly
- [ ] Security updates applied
- [ ] Backup procedures tested
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## Common Security Issues to Avoid

1. **Hardcoded Secrets**: Never commit API keys or passwords to version control
2. **Weak Session Management**: Use secure session configuration
3. **Insufficient Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Information Disclosure**: Don't expose sensitive data in error messages
5. **Insecure File Handling**: Validate file uploads and prevent path traversal
6. **Missing Security Headers**: Implement appropriate security headers
7. **Outdated Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date

## Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for authentication flows
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis

### Manual Testing

- Penetration testing
- Security code review
- Configuration review
- Social engineering assessment

## Compliance

The application implements security measures to help meet common compliance requirements:

- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of uploaded files and user data
- **Access Control**: Proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for security monitoring
- **Encryption**: Secure data transmission and storage
