COMPUTER SCIENCE EXAM - MARKING GUIDE

QUESTION 1: Define object-oriented programming and explain its main principles. (25 marks)

Expected Answer: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" which contain data and code. Main principles include:
- Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods together
- Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones
- Polymorphism: Objects of different types responding to the same interface
- Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details

QUESTION 2: 
a) What is inheritance in object-oriented programming? (10 marks)
b) Provide an example of polymorphism in Java or Python. (15 marks)

Expected Answers:
a) Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and methods from an existing class. The new class is called a subclass or derived class, and the existing class is called a superclass or base class.

b) Example of polymorphism:
```python
class Animal:
    def make_sound(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def make_sound(self):
        return "Meow!"
```

QUESTION 3: Explain the difference between a class and an object in OOP. (20 marks)

Expected Answer: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It specifies what attributes and methods objects of that type will have. An object is an instance of a class - it's a concrete realization of the class with actual values for its attributes.
