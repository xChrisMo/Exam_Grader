                Case Study: Netflix's Transformation from DVD-by-Mail to Streaming Giant
                
                Background: Netflix was founded in 1997 as a DVD-by-mail service. In 2007, they launched their streaming service, and by 2013, they had transitioned to become primarily a streaming platform while also investing heavily in original content production.
                
                Financial Data:
                - 2007 Revenue: $1.2 billion (primarily DVD)
                - 2020 Revenue: $25 billion (primarily streaming)
                - Current subscribers: 230+ million globally
                - Content investment: $15+ billion annually
                
                Questions for Analysis:
                
                1. Analyze Netflix's strategic transformation from a traditional DVD rental business to a streaming platform. What were the key factors that enabled this successful pivot? (30 marks)
                
                2. Evaluate Netflix's decision to invest heavily in original content production. Calculate the ROI implications and assess the strategic benefits beyond financial returns. (35 marks)
                
                3. Develop a strategic recommendation for Netflix's next phase of growth. Consider emerging technologies, market saturation, and competitive pressures. (35 marks)
