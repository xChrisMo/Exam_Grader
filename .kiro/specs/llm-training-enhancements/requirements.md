# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the LLM training functionality by adding automatic refresh capabilities when datasets are successfully created and providing delete functionality for documents and tests. These improvements will streamline the user workflow and provide better control over training data management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user managing LLM training data, I want the interface to automatically refresh when a dataset is created successfully, so that I can immediately see the updated dataset list without manual page refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dataset creation operation completes successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the dataset list display
2. WHEN the dataset list refreshes THEN the system SHALL show the newly created dataset in the list
3. WHEN the refresh occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the current user's position and context on the page
4. IF the dataset creation fails THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger an automatic refresh

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user managing training documents, I want to delete individual documents from the training data, so that I can remove incorrect or unwanted documents without recreating the entire dataset.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the document list THEN the system SHALL display a delete button for each document
2. WHEN a user clicks the delete button THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
3. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove the document from the dataset
4. WHEN a document is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL update the document list display
5. WHEN a document deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. IF a document is currently being used in active training THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show a warning message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user managing training tests, I want to delete individual test cases, so that I can remove outdated or incorrect test data from my training sets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the test list THEN the system SHALL display a delete button for each test case
2. WHEN a user clicks the delete button THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation before deletion
3. WHEN deletion is confirmed THEN the system SHALL remove the test case from the dataset
4. WHEN a test case is successfully deleted THEN the system SHALL update the test list display
5. WHEN a test deletion fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
6. IF a test case is currently being used in active training THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show a warning message
