# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical 500 Internal Server Error occurring when attempting to start LLM training jobs. The error stems from a service initialization issue where the training service fails to initialize properly due to a method signature mismatch in the BaseService.track_request() method. This fix will ensure the LLM training functionality works reliably and provides proper error handling and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user attempting to start LLM training jobs, I want the training job start endpoint to work without throwing 500 errors, so that I can successfully initiate model training.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Start Training" on a valid training job THEN the system SHALL successfully start the training job without throwing a 500 error
2. WHEN the training service initializes THEN the system SHALL properly initialize the LLM service without method signature errors
3. WHEN the start training endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return appropriate success or error responses with proper HTTP status codes
4. IF the training service fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and return a meaningful error message to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer debugging the system, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the training service, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL log the specific error details including stack traces
2. WHEN the track_request context manager is used THEN the system SHALL properly handle the context without method signature errors
3. WHEN training operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages in both logs and API responses
4. WHEN the training service health check runs THEN the system SHALL accurately report the service status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the LLM training interface, I want clear feedback when training operations fail, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a training job fails to start THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN the training service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL show appropriate status indicators in the UI
3. WHEN service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL prevent users from attempting training operations until the issue is resolved
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable guidance where possible
