# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Exam Grader application currently has issues with proper shutdown when stopped, leaving processes running and potentially causing resource leaks. This feature will implement a comprehensive graceful shutdown system that ensures all services, connections, and background processes are properly terminated when the application is stopped.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to shut down gracefully when stopped, so that no background processes remain running and system resources are properly released.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application receives a shutdown signal (SIGINT, SIGTERM) THEN the system SHALL initiate a graceful shutdown sequence
2. WHEN graceful shutdown is initiated THEN the system SHALL stop accepting new requests within 2 seconds
3. WHEN graceful shutdown is initiated THEN the system SHALL complete all in-progress requests within 30 seconds or terminate them
4. WHEN graceful shutdown is initiated THEN the system SHALL properly close all database connections
5. WHEN graceful shutdown is initiated THEN the system SHALL stop all background services (file cleanup, SocketIO, etc.)
6. WHEN graceful shutdown is initiated THEN the system SHALL release all file handles and temporary resources
7. WHEN the shutdown sequence completes THEN the system SHALL exit with status code 0

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive shutdown logging, so that I can troubleshoot any shutdown issues and verify proper cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN graceful shutdown begins THEN the system SHALL log the start of shutdown sequence with timestamp
2. WHEN each service is being stopped THEN the system SHALL log the service name and shutdown status
3. WHEN shutdown encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN shutdown completes THEN the system SHALL log total shutdown time and final status
5. IF shutdown takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL log warning messages about delayed shutdown

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the shutdown system to handle force termination scenarios, so that the application can still clean up critical resources even when forced to stop.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application receives SIGTERM after SIGINT THEN the system SHALL perform emergency cleanup within 5 seconds
2. WHEN emergency cleanup is triggered THEN the system SHALL prioritize database connection cleanup
3. WHEN emergency cleanup is triggered THEN the system SHALL attempt to save any critical in-progress data
4. WHEN emergency cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate status code
5. IF emergency cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log critical errors and exit immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved batch scripts for stopping the application, so that I can reliably terminate the application from the command line.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stop_server.bat is executed THEN the system SHALL first attempt graceful shutdown via signal
2. WHEN graceful shutdown fails or times out THEN the system SHALL fall back to process termination
3. WHEN force_stop.bat is executed THEN the system SHALL immediately terminate all related processes
4. WHEN batch scripts run THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about shutdown progress
5. WHEN batch scripts complete THEN the system SHALL verify no related processes remain running

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to handle shutdown during critical operations, so that data integrity is maintained even during unexpected termination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN shutdown occurs during file processing THEN the system SHALL complete or safely abort the current operation
2. WHEN shutdown occurs during database transactions THEN the system SHALL commit or rollback transactions appropriately
3. WHEN shutdown occurs during OCR/LLM operations THEN the system SHALL cancel pending requests and clean up temporary files
4. WHEN shutdown occurs during file uploads THEN the system SHALL either complete or clean up partial uploads
5. IF critical operations cannot be completed safely THEN the system SHALL log the incomplete operations for recovery
