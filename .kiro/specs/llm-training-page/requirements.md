# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a dedicated page for fine-tuning LLM models like DeepSeek and other supported models by uploading custom documents. The page will provide a flexible interface to select different LLM providers, upload training documents, configure fine-tuning parameters, and generate comprehensive reports about the training process and model improvements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from different LLM models (DeepSeek, etc.), so that I can choose the best model for my specific training needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the training page THEN the system SHALL display a dropdown with available LLM models including DeepSeek
2. WHEN a model is selected THEN the system SHALL display model-specific configuration options and capabilities
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show the currently selected model and its status
4. IF a model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and disable selection

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents for training, so that I can fine-tune the model with my specific content and data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the document upload section THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop interface for file uploads
2. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats including PDF, TXT, DOCX, and JSON
3. WHEN files are processed THEN the system SHALL validate document content and extract text for training
4. IF invalid files are uploaded THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and file format requirements
5. WHEN documents are successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a summary of training data including word count and document types
6. WHEN multiple documents are uploaded THEN the system SHALL allow users to organize them into training datasets

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure fine-tuning parameters, so that I can optimize the training process for my specific model and use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses training configuration THEN the system SHALL display model-specific parameters including learning rate, batch size, epochs, and temperature
2. WHEN parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL provide real-time validation and suggested ranges based on the selected model
3. IF invalid parameters are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors with recommended values
4. WHEN configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL store settings as templates for future training sessions
5. WHEN different models are selected THEN the system SHALL adjust available parameters accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to start fine-tuning sessions, so that I can train the selected model with my uploaded documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Start Training" THEN the system SHALL initiate fine-tuning using the selected model and uploaded documents
2. WHEN training is initiated THEN the system SHALL validate that documents are uploaded and parameters are configured
3. IF prerequisites are not met THEN the system SHALL display a checklist of missing requirements
4. WHEN training starts THEN the system SHALL display real-time progress including completion percentage and estimated time remaining
5. WHEN training is in progress THEN the system SHALL prevent starting additional sessions and show current session status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to generate detailed training reports, so that I can analyze how well the fine-tuning improved my model's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL automatically generate a comprehensive training report
2. WHEN a report is generated THEN it SHALL include training duration, loss reduction, model performance metrics, and before/after comparisons
3. WHEN a user requests historical reports THEN the system SHALL display a list of all previous training sessions with model names and dates
4. WHEN a historical report is selected THEN the system SHALL display the full report with charts, metrics, and training data summary
5. WHEN reports are viewed THEN the system SHALL provide export options in PDF and JSON formats
6. WHEN reports are generated THEN they SHALL include sample outputs showing model improvement

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to compare different training sessions, so that I can identify which models and configurations work best for my data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects multiple training sessions THEN the system SHALL display a comparison view with side-by-side metrics
2. WHEN comparing sessions THEN the system SHALL show model types, training parameters, performance improvements, and training duration
3. WHEN comparison data is displayed THEN the system SHALL highlight the best-performing model and configuration
4. WHEN comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL allow saving comparison reports for future reference

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my uploaded documents and training datasets, so that I can organize and reuse training data effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses document management THEN the system SHALL display all uploaded documents with metadata including size, type, and upload date
2. WHEN documents are managed THEN the system SHALL allow organizing them into named datasets for different training purposes
3. WHEN datasets are created THEN the system SHALL show statistics including total documents, word count, and content preview
4. WHEN documents are selected THEN the system SHALL allow deletion, renaming, and dataset assignment
5. WHEN training data is managed THEN the system SHALL show which documents were used in previous training sessions
