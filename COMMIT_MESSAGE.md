refactor: major codebase cleanup and architecture consolidation

- Remove redundant and deprecated services (40+ files deleted)
  - Eliminated duplicate LLM training, monitoring, and processing services
  - Removed obsolete background task implementations
  - Cleaned up redundant error handling and validation services
  - Deleted unused API endpoints and route handlers

- Consolidate core service architecture
  - Streamlined service registry and initialization
  - Unified configuration management across modules
  - Enhanced security middleware and session handling
  - Improved database models and optimization utilities

- Add new training and monitoring capabilities
  - Implement training dashboard with real-time progress tracking
  - Add comprehensive training report generation with PDF export
  - Create training visualization and performance monitoring
  - Establish secure file handling for training data

- Enhance frontend components
  - Add training-specific JavaScript modules and UI components
  - Implement WebSocket-based real-time communication
  - Create responsive training dashboard templates
  - Improve error handling and user feedback systems

- Improve testing infrastructure
  - Add comprehensive test suites for accessibility, security, and performance
  - Implement integration tests for training workflows
  - Create system-level validation and requirement checks
  - Establish proper test configuration and reporting

- Update configuration and deployment
  - Add consistency configuration for system behavior
  - Update environment examples and database reset utilities
  - Improve logging configuration and structured error handling
  - Enhance security configuration and input validation

This refactoring significantly reduces code duplication, improves maintainability,
and establishes a cleaner architecture for the exam grading platform while
adding robust training capabilities and monitoring systems.
