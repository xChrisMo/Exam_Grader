## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Model Test Creation Fails
**Symptoms**: Error when creating new test session
**Causes**: 
- Training job not completed
- Insufficient permissions
- Database connection issues

**Solutions**:
1. Verify training job status is 'completed'
2. Check user permissions
3. Restart database connection

#### File Processing Fails
**Symptoms**: Documents show "processing failed" status
**Causes**:
- Unsupported file format
- Corrupted files
- Missing dependencies

**Solutions**:
1. Check file format is supported
2. Try re-uploading the file
3. Install required processing libraries

#### Test Execution Hangs
**Symptoms**: Test shows "running" status indefinitely
**Causes**:
- Large number of submissions
- Resource constraints
- Network issues

**Solutions**:
1. Cancel and restart with fewer submissions
2. Check system resources
3. Verify network connectivity

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Datasets:
- Process documents in batches
- Use background processing
- Implement caching for repeated operations

#### For Multiple Tests:
- Limit concurrent test execution
- Queue tests when system is busy
- Monitor resource usage

### Monitoring

#### Key Metrics to Monitor:
- Test execution times
- File processing success rates
- Error frequencies by type
- System resource usage
- User activity patterns

#### Logging:
- All operations are logged with appropriate levels
- Error details include context and recovery suggestions
- Performance metrics are tracked for optimization

### Support

For additional support:
- Check the troubleshooting section above
