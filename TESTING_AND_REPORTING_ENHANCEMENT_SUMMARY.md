    """Test submission with real LLM calls"""
    # Real LLM evaluation
    evaluation_response = llm_service.generate_response(
        system_prompt="You are an AI model trained for educational assessment",
        user_prompt=test_prompt,
        temperature=0.2
    )
    
    # Extract actual scores
    predicted_score = extract_score_from_llm_response(evaluation_response)
    
    # Calculate real accuracy vs expected
    accuracy = calculate_accuracy(predicted_score, expected_score)
```

### **Intelligent Report Generation**
```python
def _generate_comprehensive_report(self, report_id, training_jobs, test_submissions):
    """Generate report with real LLM analysis"""
    # Analyze each training job
    job_analysis = llm_service.generate_response(
        system_prompt="You are an expert ML engineer analyzing training performance",
        user_prompt=job_analysis_prompt,
        temperature=0.3
    )
    
    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = llm_service.generate_response(
        system_prompt="Provide actionable recommendations for improvement",
        user_prompt=recommendations_prompt
    )
```
